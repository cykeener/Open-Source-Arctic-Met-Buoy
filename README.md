# Open-Source-Arctic-Met-Buoy
General info, PCB design files, and hull / enclosure design files to build a meteorological (met) buoy to collect GPS location, external temperature, and atmospheric pressure in a cold weather environment.  This version of the buoy was designed in the fall of 2018, and deployed in the winter of 2019.

The intent of this repository is to maintain general info, PCB design files (from Eagle), 3D printable stl files (from Fusion 360), and a series of BOMs that will allow the user to build an open source met buoy that runs on Arduino code maintained by tgidave https://github.com/tgidave/icedrifter
